 Rotating gear is a major component of the industrial world, yet unplanned malfunctions can result in costly downtime and safety risks. By analysing vibration data from machines, deep learning algorithms can identify minute patterns that point to wear and tear, enabling us to anticipate and stop breakdowns before they happen. The focus of this project will be to develop and execute an intelligent system for diagnosis and prognosis. The system will have the capability to detect the degradation of RMs components, predict the RUL, and subsequently classify the nature of the defect that will happen. The system will improve its diagnostics and prognostics system by using DL techniques for analysing vibration data generated by the bearings. The accomplishment of this objective will be facilitated by the development of the system. After detecting the deterioration and classifying the issue, the system will proceed to calculate the RUL. Preventative maintenance can be implemented through the identification of multiple issues which includes bearing flaws. This enables the prevention of costly times of inactivity and the decrease in expenses related to repairs, respectively. In addition, The method in problem solving involves providing a category string label to each individual data point to classify them according to their corresponding category. The labels categorised into four distinct classifications: healthy, degradation and faulty stage.
